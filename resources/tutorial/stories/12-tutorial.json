    "body": "When you start using The Randomist, you get a sample set of tutorial tables. This story explains each one, please have a look at them, play with them, and then start creating your own or using others!\nRandomise your Imagination!\n\n\nA list of colours, no lines numbers are present. Each item on a separate line. Give it a try\n\nTutorial 1 - Colours\nBlack\nBlue\nRed\nGreen\nWhite\nYellow\nOrange\n\n\nLine Numbers are useful. You specify the  number followed by a double colon.\nThe numbers can be a range to give that entry more chance/weight\nIf all the entries on your Table have the same chance then you do not need to add numbers\nNote: You cannot mix lines with and without numbers in same Table\nIt's either line numbers or not\n\nTutorial 2 - Gems\n1::Diamond\n2::Emerald\n3-5::Topaz\n6-8::Opal\n9::Ruby\n10::Sapphire\n11-15::Amethyst\n16-20::Garnet\n\n\nGenerating numbers, note the number generators are surrounded by double brackets\n\nTutorial 3 - Generating Numbers\n((<number of dice>d<die type>)), e.g. ((2d4)), ((3d6)), ((1d20))\n((<low range>-<high range>)), e.g ((1-10)), ((13-24)), ((1-100))\n((<number of dice>d<die type>x<multiplier>)), e.g. ((3d6x10)), ((1d12x100))\n((<number of dice>d<die type>+<add>)), e.g. ((2d4+2)), ((3d6+4))\n((<number of dice>d<die type>-<subtract>)), e.g. ((4d4-1)), ((3d6-2))\n((<low range>-<high range>x<multiplier>)), e.g. ((1-10x100)), ((3-18x10))\n((dice chain)), e.g ((1d6+1d4+1)), ((3d6+2d8-2)), ((6+1d6+1d8-2))\n\n\nWhat's the fun of random tables unless you can start linking them together.\n\nTutorial 4 - Linking tables\nMy favourite colour is <<username.table.tutorial-1-colours>>\nMy favourite gem is  <<username.table.tutorial-2-gems>>\nPick a <<username.table.tutorial-3-generating-numbers>> number\n\n\nMore interesting ways of linking tables, using multipliers with links, and line numbers.\n\nTutorial 5 - Linking tables Advanced\n1-3::My favourite colours are is ((1d4+1x<<username.table.tutorial-1-colours>>))\n4-8::My favourite gems are  ((2-5<<username.table.tutorial-2-gems>>))\n9-12::Pick a <<username.table.tutorial-3-generating-numbers>> number\n13::Links within links - <<username.table.linking-tables>>\n\n\nThe fun of random tables come from when they are combined in a macro.\n\nTutorial 6 - First Macro\nYou are in front of a <<username.table.tutorial-1-colours>> house, upon the door is knocker\ninset with a large <<username.table.tutorial-2-gems>>.\nThere are ((2d6)) windows scattered across the frontage.\nFrom with a voice can be heard reciting - \"<<username.table.tutorial-3-generating-numbers>>\"\n\n\nSame as tables macros can link to tables or macros, with multipliers if required.\n\nTutorial 7 - Linking Macros and Tables\nA cluster of strange houses - ((1d6x<<username.macro.tutorial-6-first-macro>>))\nThe road that leads to them is coloured ((3-4x<<username.table.tutorial-1-colours>>))\n\n\nTutorial 8 - Chance\n20% chance of having a gem - <<20% username.table.tutorial-2-gems>>\n50% chance of coloured item - <<50% username.table.tutorial-1-colours>> thing\n\n\nTutorial 9 - Loops\nLooping Tutorial\n\nProgrammatic commands are enclosed in [[ ]]\n\n[[LOOP:tutorial]]\nA <<username.table.tutorial-1-colours>> <<username.table.tutorial-2-gems>>\n[[ENDLOOP:tutorial:5]]\n\nBreaking that down the LOOP:tutorial represents the start of the loop and the loop name.\nthe ENDLOOP:tutorial:5 represents the end of the loop for that variable and the maximum number of\niterations. Each loop will do at least one pass.\n\n\nTutorial 10 - IF\n\nIF are used with the chance %\n[[IF:25%:Then something happens, can also link to tables and macros]]\n\n\nTutorial 11 - Choice\n\nUsable within macros and tables\n[[CHOICE:Nothing here:((1d20x<<username.table.gems>>)):A <<username.table.colours>> cow, standing next to a <<username.table.colours>> beanstalk.]]\n\nCHOICE is followed by a number of colon separated options. One of which will be picked.\n\n\n",
