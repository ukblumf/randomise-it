  "body": "Share\n-----------------\nWhen you have created a great table or macro or even a set of tables and macros, you can share them to other users of the Randomist.\nGo to the share page and select what content you want to push out there, give it a title and description to describe and promote your random genius and click Share, these will then appear on the Discover screen for other users.\nIf you have a lot of tables and macros, collate them in a Collection, it makes them easier to share all at once and easier for users to pin to their stories.\n\nWhen someone selects your content they will be able to generate results from it but won't be able to view/edit the content of your macros/tables/collections.\n\nLikewise you can get to all that wonderful randomness created by other users by going to Discover and seeing what is available, if you have already selected an item it won't appear again in Discover.\n\n\nThe Manage Screen\n-----------------------\nHere is where you can delete or update content you have shared or have added into your library.\n\nIf you update content you have previously shared, it appears here and allows you to refresh the public version.",
