  "body": "When you have created a great table or macro or even a set of tables and macros, you can share them to other users of the Randomist. \nGo to the share page and select what content you want to push out there, give it a title and description to describe and promote your random genius and click Share, these will then appear on the Discover screen for other users.\nIf you have a lot of tables and macros, collate them in a Collection, it makes them easier to share all at once and easier for users to pin to their stories.\n\nWhen someone selects your content they will not be able to see the actual tables or macros, only use them to generate results.\n\nLikewise you can get to all that wonderful randomness created by other users by going to Discover and seeing what is available, if you have already selected an item it won't appear again in Discover.\n\nThe Manage Screen\nHere is where you can delete or update content you have shared or have added to your library.\n\nIf you update content your have previously shared in the manage screen it appears and allows you to refresh the public version.\n",
