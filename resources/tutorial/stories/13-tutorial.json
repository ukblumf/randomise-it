    "body": "Stories are where your random tables and macros come alive, clicking on the table or macro will show a popup which shows what has been selected, if you don't like what is about to be inserted into your story click refresh, or 'x' to quit.\nWhen Insert is clicked the text is inserted where ever your cursor is.\n\nThis story has the tutorial macros and tables pinned to the top. Tables, Macros and Collections can be pinned to a story to help with it's creation. They can be removed by right-clicking.  Handy for when you refer to a table a lot, e.g. A Random name generator.\n\n\nCollections are a way of organising your tables and macros.\nThey can also include other collections. When pinned in a story they become a drop down menu, which saves on space in the pinned area.\n\nYou can aid organisation of your tables, macros and collections by creating and assigning tags to them. These can be anything you want.\nYou will see that a tutorial tag has been created and applied to the tables, macros and collections in the tutorial.\nSelecting the tag just shows content associated with that tag.\n",
