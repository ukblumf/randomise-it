  "The town guard think the party’s mage is responsible for a magical duel fought atop the cathe- dral roof last night. Can the party  nd the real culprit before they are hunted down themselves? Do they dare, knowing that the criminal dispatched his last opponent with a frighteningly high level spell?",

  "A lead in your case brings you to a dive bar in the bad side of town. You ask around and  nd out your suspect is staying upstairs in the owner’s room. You walk up and open the door to  nd three armed gangsters surrounding your target who’s slipping out the  re escape.",
  "Upon returning to your room at the inn, you discover a body on the  oor with a dagger lying be- side it. Soon after, guards storm up the stairs and into your room.",
  "The party hears a rumor about work from temple. When they arrive, they  nd themselves in an empty temple. Once they reach the center of the temple, the entire congregation rushes in and take the party down into the crypt.",
  "The party is on their way to the tavern at which they are staying when two groups of street  ghters armed with rocks and sticks rush onto opposite sides of the street with the party caught in the middle. One group is wearing green, the other yellow.",
  "The party stops to witness a funeral procession for a crime lord. Soon after passing, the party hears an explosion and sees a gigantic smoking  reball rise into the sky a block away.",
  "In need of food and shelter from the elements (or from enemies), the characters come to a ru- ined tower full of revelling adventurers. But the Rules of the House say no one may enter until they have entertained the rabble with a rousing tale.",
  "As you step out of the tavern, a disheveled girl smashes into you. 'Wilkenson’s dog is loose again!' she exclaims as she attempts to hide behind you. You turn back in the direction she came to see a metal construct resembling a dog charging toward you.",
  "The PCs spot a pregnant woman walking through the bazaar. As she passes the baker’s stall she quickly grabs a loaf of bread and keeps walking, favouring one of the PCs with a wink as she goes. Is she a thief or the wife of the store owner?",
  "The PCs are walking along a busy street. A residential door opens brie y and a high pitched scream emits from inside before the door suddenly closes again. None of the other people on the street seem to react.",
  "The PCs are resting in their inn room when suddenly the door bursts open. A well-armed man with weapon drawn storms in and says, 'Don’t move, I’ve...crap, wrong room.' The intruder then quickly exits.",
  "The PCs  nd the item they have been seeking in the marketplace. As the purchase is completed and they are about to leave, a stranger rushes up to the merchant shouting, 'I know you have it Balthasar, and I want my <insert item here> back now!'",
  "As the PCs turn up the street they hear shouting ahead. Within moments they see an escaping carriage barreling towards them without a driver. If the PCs are able to stop the carriage they will see signs of maltreatment of the horses (severe bit, lacerated skin from the whip).",
  "The inhabitants of a large building start a war against an identical neighboring building. At the beginning it’s because they are accused of stealing their water, but in fact they have held many petty grudges for years and this way they can vent them out violently. The party is hired by fearful authorities to stop the revolt that threatens to scale into a civil war, but one of the tenants in the rebel building is a PC’s distant relative. Does the party intervene impartially, risking a family feud or do they help the relative exact revenge against his neighbors?",
  "An invaluable piece of treasure is thought to be somewhere in the sewers of the city, which leads the PCs to a dumpster. Behind the rubbish a criminal empire rises,  nancing itself by repro- cessing and using what the city no longer consider useful or falls in the trash, like the piece of treasure. Will the party confront the Trash Emperor to recover the treasure, or do they leave it as a sign of good will?",
  "The party is mistaken by a wealthy man as carriage caretakers in a shantytown neighborhood. He hands them money to protect his vehicle. The legitimate caretakers challenge the PCs and try to steal the wealthy wagon. Does the party protect the rich man’s vehicle or do they leave the locals to do as they please, risking later persecution by the noble client?",
  "An obese and corrupt food merchant accuses the party of stealing his rotten food and threatens with a call to the corrupt authorities. Does the party  ght their way out, run away, confront the false accusations or pay the merchant?",
  "The PCs arrive at the inn and  nd a large group (at least three times their number) of merce- naries leaving for the jail where they plan to execute all the prisoners. The party is connected to one of the inmates (an old, recurrent, but not particularly hated enemy, maybe they put him be- hind bars in the  rst place) and wishes him to remain alive for some reason. Do they face the kill- ers, race to save the prisoner  rst, warn the prisoners or set them all free?",
  "A black market thug offers an illegal but coveted article to the PCs; however, he is not carry- ing it around. Just as the deal is completed, a guard raid starts and the merchant runs away. Does the party run after him, looking suspiciously related to crime, or do they help the guards arrest the thug, risking loss of their money and the coveted item?",
  "The city has a zoo  lled with wondrous and dangerous creatures brought from far places. Just recently, some of the creatures escaped and now there is a royal reward for recovering the rare animals unharmed. How can this be done?",
  "One of the richest houses of the city is plagued by small, magically resistant and sly creatures. The mansion guards a large collection of  ne birds and exotic vegetation, delicate and sensitive. Can the party exterminate the plague while keeping the collection safe?",
  "A sector of the city lies under quarantine after an outbreak of a mysterious fever. The party is being kept inside, and one of its members is starting to show symptoms of the illness. Do they try to escape, risking further contagion, or do they try to  nd a cure from the inside?",
  "The PCs are being chased by a criminal party through the streets of a city that celebrates its anniversary with improvised shows over plazas. They get caught in the middle of a show, in front of a demanding audience. The only way the mob will let them leave is by doing a successful artistic performance.",
  "A gypsy intercepts the most charismatic member of the party and tells him of a vision she had. She predicts the party member will  nd a beautiful person in this city and it will be the love of his life. She provides no further details. Later on, a beautiful person  irts with the character.",
  "The PCs arrive at an over-visited shrine-city in the middle of a celebration attended by clerics from every corner of the land. All inns are full, it is forbidden to stay outside of the city and there is nowhere to stay. The mobs of homeless people are not kind to strangers either. How can the party survive the night?",
  "One member of the party is seen carrying an exotic weapon and the authority of the local museum is told about it. This museum curator has been an adventurer and masters some kind of whip weapon. He prepares an ambush to steal the exotic weapon, yelling at the PCs on sight, 'That belongs in a museum!'",
  "The PCs travel to a city famous for its elegance and glamour, where everybody has a fashion sense. In the crowded plaza, one of the characters bumps into a citizen and loses his purse. When he  nds out he realizes everybody looks the same because all are using the same fashionable gar- ments of this season.",
  "The impoverished city charges adventurers an entry tax of 10% of their loot. The of cers in charge use magical detection spells to enforce the embargo. Citizens in line offer to take care of the largest parts of the adventurers’ treasure to cheat on the taxation, in exchange of a fee. How- ever, some of these citizens are thieves who use the situation to steal treasure from adventurers, and they guard the stolen loot in a nearby cave. Will the party surrender their treasure to tax or will they risk it to a theft?",
  "The Tourist. The PCs have messed up (possibly been framed) in the eyes of the King and have been apprehended. The King will release the party, if they allow a wealthy, in uential and obese merchant to come along on a dungeon delve, where there are sure to be many tight spaces.",
  "Medieval Proliferation. Two blacksmiths are in competition to create better melee weapons for the King’s army and only one can win the contract. One of the blacksmiths approaches the PCs to try the weapons and plead their virtues to the King. He also claims his competitors are playing dirty.",
  "Ritual Addiction. A cult rises to prominence and almost becomes a legitimate religion through the use of addicting rituals, which all followers must perform and then become addicted to. How will the PCs stop a growing cult, of which the members are powerless to escape even if they want to?",
  "Kindergarten Magic. Street urchins are rumored to have special powers. A representative of the Magicians Guild approaches your party to investigate. In reality, they are learning magic from an unknown source. The children have less inhibition and magical control, but have much more mana and capability of replenishing mana, making them dangerous magic users.",
  "As the PCs turn a corner, a law enforcement of cer slams into them at breakneck speed. As they help him up, they notice he is covered in blood with grievous wounds. As he dies in their arms, he begs them to  nd his wife and relay his sincerest love and apologies.",
  "'Psst, do you want to buy a crystal ball that really works? It’s cheap!' says a shady character while sneaking up on the PCs from an alley. The price really is cheap, and you might even lead the PCs to believe the ball works when they try to use it for petty things, but it is unreliable, maybe even cursed. And the big problem is that one or more groups of NPCs badly want this crystal ball.",
  "The PCs witness a break-in at a shop. If they intervene, then right at the end of the encounter the shop owner shows up and accuses the PCs of breaking in and causing damage in his shop. He immediately calls for the guard.",
  "The PCs are searching for someone, and just as they  nd him the person falls dead, the tar- get of an assassination attempt. Before the group can begin to search for clues or  nd out who is responsible, the guard shows up, possibly tipped off by the assassin, and accuse the party of the crime.",
  "While searching for someone in an unfamiliar part of the city, the party crosses into the terri- tory of a faction and triggers an encounter. Unknown to the characters, the group that is upset with them has some in uence with the target of the PCs’ quest.",

  "The whole city is under a reverse gravity spell, and kuo-toas, unaffected by the spell, are at- tacking from the harbor.",
  "The party runs over or mortally injures a shepherd’s goat by accident. After apologizing, the shepherd starts demanding money equivalent to three or four times what the goat’s value is. Then, as things settle down, another shepherd comes up and displays another goat injured. City guards start to show an interest in the event as well....",
  "A rich merchant in a coach, escorted by off-duty city watch, attempts to race through a gate, only to be stopped by the on-duty guards. The merchant is angry at this, as he paid the guards to allow him to travel freely without paying any fees or having to give way. A violent standoff occurs.",
  "A merchant discovers the PCs are buying something and comes to give them a more expensive offer for something of lesser quality. However, the merchant insists this is a good deal as his cousin works for the town hall and will cause great grief to the party if they refuse his offer.",
  "A trusted NPC tries to get the PCs to buy a horse from his brother instead of the dubious-quality horse the PCs intend to purchase. It does not seem clear that the new horse is any better than the other horse.",
  "Two speeding coaches collide, leaving a bloody scene and angry families. The road is blocked, and the guards seem disinterested in assisting with either clearing the road or arbitrating between the families.",
  "The royal poobah arrives and the main road is blocked inde nitely by royal guards. All traf c must take the back streets.",
  "Bandits strike a merchant convoy. Two wagons are left burning, while two others have been stolen. Most of the guards in the area rush off after the attackers.",

  "A party member is challenged to a duel by a young spellslinger.",
  "A religious ceremony requires that everybody attends with no exceptions. Some who do not are committing crimes in the meantime. Will the PCs be missing from church?",
  "An authoritarian female  gure requires the services of the PCs to make her husband jealous or look weak. He is decidedly displeased unless the PCs handle the situation with great tact.",
  "A clerk decides for some perceived slight that he just won’t give the PCs the help they need. Attempts to remedy the situation make it worse.",
  "There is but one accepted religion in town. What about the party cleric who serves what is here deemed a false god?",
  "Young lovers have taken the PCs’ room as refuge to meet in. They are sought after by families that do not approve.",
  "A rider storms down the crowded main road of the town, expecting everyone to dive out of the way or be crushed.",
  "A lynch mob forms in the tavern where the PCs are. To join or to risk their drunken wrath?",
  "A lonely religious type starts trailing the PCs, shouting they are the harbingers of imminent doom, which is annoying and prevents trading. Most deem him harmless and he is a local, whereas the PCs are anything but.",
  "A game of chance in the market goes wrong for the PCs; it may be crooked or simply the source of a brawl.",
  "A damsel in distress is pinned under a fallen wagon. A strong PC can save her, but doing so comes with strings attached.",

  "Injustice breaks out as revolution against a tyrant. The PCs are there to see the  rst  ames, and may play a pivotal role in either supporting or crushing the uprising.",
  "A fast ship in the bay is bombarding the helpless port with siege engines. It’s out of range for the locals to deal with, and possibly not alone.",
  "The PCs hear shrieks from a dark alley where a young maiden just went. Under the full moon, she is painfully turning into a werewolf for the  rst time.",

  "The governor, a friend of the PCs, fears he’ll be removed by his superior and turns to them for assistance. He’s right to fear, though not all details are correct.",
  "An entertainer in the market works in tandem with pickpockets. Finding someone who stole, or attempted to steal, something does not make recovery easy in the middle of an enthusiastic crowd.",
  "A vendor tries to sell the PCs something and won’t take no for an answer. He may want to force a sale, or is simply after a con ict for his own reasons.",
  "Actions of the PCs mark them as being on the side of one family in a long-term feud. One or both of the families takes interest in the party as a result.",
  "One or more PCs are present as witnesses of a street crime, violent or otherwise. To intervene makes for enemies, risk and delay. To not intervene gives social pariah status, lost allies and favour.",
  "One or more PCs are short-changed by a merchant who considers himself untouchable. Whether he truly is....",
  "One of more PCs are made party to a crime. What to do after  nding some incriminating loot in their room before / during / after the law appears?",
  "An NPC seeks the protection of the PCs. To grant it makes her enemies the PCs’ enemies, and gives them the responsibility to protect a high-pro le, fragile person who can’t or won’t leave town.",
  "A thief offers to serve the PCs as guide, and serves them well. Except for robbing from locals while doing it and hiding behind the party for security.",
  "PCs are marked by a guild of thieves or assassins for a contest. Low-skill, would-be guild mem- bers keep targeting the party with attempts on their health or goods.",
  "A beautiful local appears to fall in love with a PC, but her affections are the result of malevo- lent magics.",
  "A soothsayer refers to the PCs in a prophecy. The details of the prophecy are undeniable, and consist of inside information to catch the PCs’ attention.",

  "A PC is witnessed in action by one who decides the character’s particular talents are just too good to pass up, and he wants to make the PC his concubine, bodyguard, or gladiator.",
  "An investigation by the PCs requires they join a secret organisation. Unfortunately, once a member always a member, and leaving town is not an option.",
  "The PCs want a special item and an artisan promises it to them. However, acquiring it requires theft of a crucial component, which makes leaving town with the item dif cult.",
  "The town is at war, and adventurers are subject to special measures, such as precautionary detainment or mandatory military service. Refusal is not taken kindly.",
  "A PC is of a character class the locals abhor. Not turning him in to authorities is treason.",
  "The appearance of the PCs breaks the balance of a cold war between two rival mages. Each wishes their support to destroy the other, and fears that the other is successful in recruiting the PCs.",
  "Being adventurers, the PCs have the main requisite for going on a quest to  nd the cure for a disease af icting townspeople: they are expendable.",

As the boat gets closer, one of the boys raises his rock as if he is going to drop it.",
  "A crowd of locals gathers, talking about cobblestones that have sunken down in a peculiar line, almost as if the ground has given way underneath. If the PCs follow the indentation, they can see one end appears to go under the cemetery wall.",
  "While travelling down by the docks, a ship captain waves the PCs over to talk. He’s in a bind, he explains, saying that some of his dock workers didn’t show up for work and he has a lot of cargo to load onto his ship so he can make the tide. The captain and crew look disreputable, and ner- vous, but he is willing to pay well for the work.",
  "The PCs come upon a sobbing woman holding a teenage boy who looks to have been severely beaten. If the PCs ask the woman if they can help, she explains her youngest son was beaten up by a gang of toughs. Of more immediate danger though, is that her oldest son has gone off to exact revenge on them, and she’s afraid of what they will do to him.",
  "Four, strong-smelling, rough-and-tumble characters enter the tavern, obviously looking to make merry. Two saddle up to the bar and pound upon it, demanding grog and hot food. Another, loudly singing a bad, off-key sea shanty, scoops up one of the bar maids and dances around the  oor with her. She smiles but shies away from his obvious bad breath and groping hands. Oblivious to her protests, he picks her up and carries her to the stairs toward the bedrooms.",
  "Down the dimly lit alley, two guards can be seen beating a kneeling man. One rips a coin purse from the kneeling man’s belt and says, 'Don’t be late next month, old man.'",
  "Behind a seedy temple, a pretty young woman cries and cowers up against a cold, stone wall. Although her clothes are of poor quality, they are attractive and revealing.

  "Walking by the docks, you are surrounded by a group of sailors carrying clubs wrapped in rags. One steps up and says, 'The Imperial navy thanks you for enlisting for a term of service!' The men proceed to attack and try to knock the player characters unconscious.",
  "While walking on a sunny side-street, a large group of happy and laughing children come skip- ping and gamboling down into the midst of the PCs. Apparently unafraid of the PCs, they continue to play their silly children’s games, occasionally bumping into characters’ legs and arms, while their gleeful group  lters through the PCs. Each child attempts to pick a pocket.",
  "A large procession of somber men beating wooden drums and chanting deeply wanders down the street, reverently carrying a large cof n.

The two groups are going to con- verge in a large town square, where the PCs are standing.",
  "A tiny, pristine white mouse with pink ears charges out of an alley and leaps onto a PC, cow- ering behind the character’s back.

He eyes the PCs and demands they tell him where the rat went, and warn they shouldn’t try to snipe his bounty on it.",
  "Storm clouds hang heavy, and thick cold rain pounds down as it has for hours. Gutters gurgle, and the sewers moan as if carrying some great weight. From a drain, a swarm of thousands of black rats burst out and charge the PCs.",
  "All the buildings along a street have their front walls separate like bread sliced off a loaf and then come crashing into the street. Who or what caused such an unnatural architectural failure?",
  "A goldsmith business celebrates their 200th year with a huge celebration wherein free necklac- es are handed out to the public. The next morning the building is gutted with no sign of the busi- ness anywhere, then people start getting sick....",

Then the PCs are secretly approached by a person claiming to be an unof cial ambassador from this place and he has terrible news for the future of their nation and his.",
  "Two men arrive at the city guard or police station at the same time as the PCs. Each claims the other assaulted him. Eyewitnesses describe a shadowy  gure dressed in grey rags from head to toe actually attacked both men. However, the men swear there was no shadowy rag man and they clearly recall the other man directly attacking him.",
  "A wizard, perhaps new to the city, sponsors a scavenger hunt to gain material components for his spells (or for the mages’ guild). Each item has a point value, and competing parties have three days to amass as many points as possible. Some are easy; some are not. Some require combat, oth- ers require ingenuity. Astute PC wizards may notice that components on the list are used to cast terrible or destructive spells (perhaps forbidden by the authorities or the guild). The reward prom- ised is huge, and greedy parties may  ght each other during the hunt. Perhaps the wizard plans to destroy the city or the guild.",
  "While walking down a street, a VIP bumps into one of the PCs and yells at him to watch his step. The VIP has bodyguards who threaten the PCs, and if they want a  ght they got it. Make it as easy or as deadly as you like. The VIP can also be an NPC the PCs have encountered before, or are about to encounter later in the campaign.",
  "The PCs spot a kobold rogue being chased by three city guards. Do they help the guards stop the kobold, or do they help the kobold get away?",
  "A mage duel gets out of hand and one participant gets his equilibrium off kilter.

The mage, in appreciation for assistance in controlling himself, offers to make a free magic item for the group.",
  "A pack of thieves working in tandem with children attempt to pick the PCs clean by acting as drunken sailors who sing bad limericks at the top of their lungs. The rogues attempt to get the PCs to join their rollicking while picking their pockets. If discovered, the would-be muggers try to escape via city roofs.",
  "As the group walks down the road, a psychopath chooses to take his angst against life out on the PCs.

  "A plague has struck the city and brutal sacri ces are being made to appease a dark plague cult that has usurped the regular religions. Friends and allies will soon be sacri ced, and the PCs could be next on the list. Perhaps the sacri ces really do help stop the spread of disease, adding a dilem- ma to the situation.",
  "It is the Great Annual (Boat, Horse, Chariot, Foot, Flying Animal) Race. This city takes the race so seriously the different permanent teams have turned into the symbols of social and political fac- tions, and post race rioting (and even violent changes of government) are obligatory. If suf ciently skilled, the PCs are recruited as substitute racers for a down-on-their luck faction after a mysteri- ous 'accident' disabled the previous team. PCs might also be hired as security for a faction or the supposedly impartial judges, and consequently get involved in the political machinations, race-  xing and hobbling attempts.",
  "Shortly after entering the city, the PCs discover everyone they interact with dies that night. The  rst few deaths might be accidents, but it becomes increasingly clear this is no coincidence. Are the PCs cursed or is someone out to get them? The city folk will start to blame the PCs soon if it doesn’t stop.",
  "The city is celebrating a Saturnalia festival during which usual social roles are reversed and everyone gets inebriated, exchanges presents, wears  ashy satirical costumes, and has a fun time while letting off some social con ict steam in a harmless way. This time, however, an internal fac- tion is planning to use the festivities to launch a violent coup. With no one in their usual job who can stop them but the PCs?",
  "The city is celebrating an unusual religious festival where random people or strangers are given temporary of ces of authority.

  "The PCs secure invites to the social event of the year, a formal masked ball held on the largest estate and gardens in the city. While invites are dearly coveted and could lead to immense in u- ence and future prospects, the PCs could easily ruin their reputation and social contacts forever through the slightest etiquette misstep: stepping on someone’s toes dancing, wearing last season’s out t, or eating exotic hor d’oeuvres incorrectly.",
  "The party  nds an abandoned half-orc baby in the gutter, newly born and mother nowhere in sight. As the savage orcs are a hated race within the city walls, what shall the party do with it?",
  "Someone falls out the window of a high building. It wasn’t suicide as he had his hands and feet bound together and three large sacks of gold tied around his neck. What will be more important, the murder or the money?",
  "A small war erupts between gangs and the party gets caught in the middle. They have two op- tions: join a gang and  ght, or  nd a way to prevent a larger war that will engulf the whole city.",

  "A mysterious and physically devastating illness quietly sweeps through the upper circle of the city and the Prince is dying.

The PCs must locate the source while a key party member  nds himself suc- cumbing to the effects of the mysterious disease.",
  "A rich man walks through a bad part of town with obvious riches and money. If mugged, he gives it willingly. He has been doing this for the last three days.",
  "A small animal brushes past the PCs as they walk along a dock. After it jumps into the water, a group of sailors rushes onto the dock,  ring crossbows and  inging harpoons at the ripples the animal left in the water.

In a low voice, he advises that a rival purveyor of vegetables has somehow sabotaged the farms the grocer relies on, and as a result he is forced to sell stale imported wares at in ated prices.

While his shop is adequate to contain the creatures, he is not capable of recap- turing them and thus cannot reopen his business. He will pay a premium price to the adventurers to capture the animals alive, 25% of the amount for any creatures killed, and he expects residual damage to be kept to a minimum, with contractual penalties!",

They’ll last for a few hits, then completely fall apart! The metal has been sabotaged so the King’s soldiers will be decimated. The blacksmith at- tempted to inform the King’s advisor, but he would not hear of it, and the blacksmith’s guild  red him and beat him up for giving them a bad name to the King.

Once they leave, it’s discovered that some people have gone missing - homeless drunks, prostitutes and children. Following the circus, the PCs won’t  nd the missing townspeople. The owner lets the PCs search around and question the workers; he has nothing to hide. An important clue is that one of the missing people had an unusual tattoo of their clan or faith on their ankle.

The massive  reball in the sky inspires panic in everyone, even royalty, who are giving large sums of money to have their souls saved  rst. The PCs investigate and stumble on some interesting facts: 1) people before this omen were not that religious, temples were visited rarely; 2) priests were barely making ends meet; 3) the  reball does not move; 4) the  reball just appeared one night, and at about the same time all the priests, monks and religious people started preaching the end of the world. The PCs  nd a large structure, possibly a oat (like a big balloon), that holds the  reball. The plan was devised by all the religious factions to help bolster their  ocks, faith, free labour, and of course, monetary donations to the churches. The plan is that, in a month, the object will disap- pear, the people saved by their religious turnabout, and donations will have to be kept up lest the object return again due to their lack of faith.",

Unfortunately, (per- haps because of some illegitimacy surrounding the PC’s birth?) one of the PCs just happens to be a spitting image of the run away Prince.

The real killer is an obsessed stalker, who follows her at night and erases the unworthy scum who are the recipients of her attention.",
